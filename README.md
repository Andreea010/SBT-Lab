## Laboratory 6
### Objectives:

* Offer user authentication via SSO using at least 3 identity providers (e.g. Facebook,
Gmail, Twitter etc.);
* Configure SSO integration to get as much as possible data about the end-user;
* Output all data which was provided by the identity providers (e.g. user’s name, age,
gender, email etc.).

## Laboratory 7
### Objectives:

* Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
via 2-way encryption);
* Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
common data and the decrypted sensitive data);
* Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
secure).
